This is a simple code for Arduino UNO board. This is use to  control one lcd (16X2) & two ultrasonic Sensor(hc-sr04).
Parts Required:
Arduino Uno Board
1* lcd (16X2)
2* Ultrasonic Sensor (hc-sr04)
1* Buzzzer
1* potentiometer
1* resistor
INSTRUCTION:
First you need to connect  Lcd pins(rs,enable,DB4,DB5,DB6,DB7) to arduino Board pin (1,2,4,5,6,7). These Wire are yellow in colour in wirring diagram
Then connect potentiometer to contrast pin of LCD.
Then connect resistor to  anode pin of LCD.
Then take first  ultrasonic and connect trigpin1 to arduino pin A0 and echopin1 to arduino pin A1.
Then take second ultrasonic and connect trigpin2 to arduino pin A2 and echopin2 to arduino pin A3.
Then connect vcc pin of both ultrasonic sensor to 5 v of board.
Then connect GND pin of both ultasonic sensor to gnd pin of board.
Then connect buzzer positive to pin 13 of UNO board.
And then Upload the code.
I havent upload it to any board but when I check it on TinkerCad simulation it just work fine.
